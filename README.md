This is a repository is a compilation of front-end and back-end projects I created during my JavaScript learning experience in a single website.

Technologies used in some projects include Node.js Express, MongoDB, Nunjucks, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, jQuery, Pug, and other JavaScript libraries.
